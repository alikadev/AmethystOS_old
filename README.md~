# AmethystOS

## A simple OS for i386 architecture

This is a really simple `OS` for `i386` architecture.

I do it because I always liked to developpe in Low Level and I really wanted to do a simple OS (similar to DOS maybe).

# Current status

For the moment, you can write text in it and it will respond to you. The commands will be implemented in the next days!

I know, this is the best OS that you ever seen!

It will be updated in next days!

# Dependancies

```
make, tcc, nasm, mtools, mkfs.fat, dd, ld, ...
I think it's everything!
