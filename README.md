# AmethystOS

## A simple OS for x86 architecture

This is a really simple `OS` for `x86` architecture.

I do it because I always liked to developpe in Low Level and I really wanted to do a simple OS (similar to DOS maybe).

# Current status

For the moment, it will boot in the bootloader. You can press key, it will print it on the screen. 

I know, this is the best thing that you ever seen!

It will be updated in next days!
